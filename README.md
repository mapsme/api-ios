## MapsWithMe iOS API: Getting Started

### Introduction

MapsWithMe offline maps API for iOS (hereinafter referred to as *API*) provides an interface for other applications to perform the following tasks:

For API version 1 (supported by MapsWithMe 2.4+)
* Open [MapsWithMe Application][linkMwm]
* Check that [MapsWithMe][linkMwm] is installed
* Show one or more points on an offline map of [MapsWithMe][linkMwm] with *Back* button and client app name in the title
* Return the user back to the client application:
 * after pressing *Back* button on the map
 * after selecting specific point on the map if user asks for more information by pressing *More Info* button in [MapsWithMe][linkMwm]
* Open any given url or url scheme after selecting specific point on the map if user asks for more information by pressing *More Info* button in [MapsWithMe][linkMwm]
* Automatically display [*Download MapsWithMe*][linkDownloadMWMDialog] dialog if [MapsWithMe][linkMwm] is not installed.

In general it is possible to establish a one way or two way communication between MapsWithMe and your app.

Please refer to the [sample application][linkSample] for a demo.

### Prerequisites

* Your application must target at least *iOS version 4.3*
* For two way communication, you should add unique [URL scheme][linkAppleCustomUrlSchemes] to your app (see below)

### Integration

First step is to clone [repository][linkRepo] or download it as an archive.

When your are done you find two folders: *api* and *capitals-example*.
First one contains .h and .m files which you need to include into your project. You can always modify them according to your needs.

If you want to get results of API calls, please add unique URL scheme to your app. You can do it with [XCode][linkAddUrlScheme] or by editing Info.plist file in your project. To make things simple, use *mapswithme* keyword in scheme ID, like *my_mapswithme_scheme*, and create an unique scheme name (or use your existing one).
*mapswithme* keyword in scheme ID simply helps API code to detect it automatically. See more details in [Apple's documentation][linkAppleCustomUrlSchemes].

*capitals-example* folder contains [sample application][linkSample] which demonstrates part of API features.

*NOTE: If you are using Automatic References Counting (ARC) in your project, you can use [this solution][linkFixARC] or simply fix code by yourself.*

### API Calls Overview and HOW TO

* All methods are static for *MWMApi* class, *BOOL* methods return *NO* if call is failed.
* If id for given pin contains valid url, it will be opened from MapsWithMe after selecting *More Info* button.
  For any other content, id will be simply passed back to the caller's [*AppDelegate application:openURL:sourceApplication:annotation:*][linkAppleDelegate] method

#### Open [MapsWithMe Application][linkMwm]

Simply opens MapsWithMe app:

    + (BOOL) showMap;
    
Example:

    [MWMApi showMap];

#### Show specified location on the map

Displays given point on a map:

    + (BOOL) showLat:(double)lat lon:(double)lon title:(NSString *)title and:(NSString *)idOrUrl;

The same as above but using pin wrapper:

    + (BOOL) showPin:(MWMPin *)pin;

Pin wrapper is a simple helper to wrap pins displayed on the map:

    @interface MWMPin : NSObject
      @property (nonatomic, assign) double lat;
      @property (nonatomic, assign) double lon;
      @property (nonatomic, retain) NSString * title;
      @property (nonatomic, retain) NSString * idOrUrl;
      - (id) initWithLat:(double)lat lon:(double)lon title:(NSString *)title and:(NSString *)idOrUrl;
    @end

Example:

    [MWMApi showLat:53.9 lon:27.56667 title:@"Minsk - the capital of Belarus" and:@"http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Minsk"];
    â€¦
    MWMPin * goldenGate = [[MWMPin alloc] init] autorelease];
    goldenGate.lat = 37.8195;
    goldenGate.lon = -122.4785;
    goldenGate.title = @"Golden Gate in San Francisco";
    goldenGate.idOrUrl = @"any number or string here you want to receive back in your app, or any url you want to be opened from MapsWithMe";
    [MWMApi showPin:goldenGate];

#### Show any number of pins on the map

    + (BOOL) showPins:(NSArray *)pins;

#### Receiving results of API calls

When users presses *Back* button in MapsWithMe, or selects *More Info* button, he is redirected back to your app.
Here are helper methods to obtain API call results:

Returns YES if url is received from MapsWithMe and can be parsed:

    + (BOOL) isMapsWithMeUrl:(NSURL *)url;

Returns nil if user didn't select any pin and simply pressed *Back* button:

    + (MWMPin *) pinFromUrl:(NSURL *)url;

Example:

    if ([MWMApi isMapsWithMeUrl:url])
    {
      // Good, here we know that your app was opened from MapsWithMe
      MWMPin * pin = [MWMApi pinFromUrl:url];
      if (pin)
      {
        // User selected specific pin, and we can get it's properties
      }
      else
      {
        // User pressed "Back" button and didn't select any pin
      }
    }

Note, that you can simply check that *sourceApplication* contains *com.mapswithme.* substring to detect that your app is opened from MapsWithMe.

#### Check that MapsWithMe is installed

Returns NO if MapsWithMe is not installed or outdated version doesn't support API calls:

    + (BOOL) isApiSupported;

With this method you can check that user needs to install MapsWithMe and display your custom UI.
Alternatively, you can do nothing and use built-in dialog which will offer users to install MapsWithMe.

### Set value if you want to open pin URL on balloon click (Available in 2.4.5)

    + (void) setOpenUrlOnBalloonClick:(BOOL)value;

### Under the hood

If you prefer to use API on your own, here are some details about the implementation.

Applications "talk" to each other using URL Scheme. API v1 supports the following parameters to the URL Scheme:

    mapswithme://map?v=1&ll=54.32123,12.34562&n=Point%20Name&id=AnyStringOrEncodedUrl&backurl=UrlToCallOnBackButton&appname=TitleToDisplayInNavBar

* **v** - API version, currently *1*
* **ll** - pin latitude and longitude, comma-separated
* **n** - pin title
* **id** - any string you want to receive back in your app, OR alternatively, any valid URL which will be opened on *More Info* button click
* **backurl** - usually, your unique app scheme to open back your app
* **appname** - string to display in navigation bar on top of the map in MapsWithMe
* **balloonAction** - pass openUrlOnBalloonClick as a parameter, if you want to open pin url on balloon click(Usually pin url opens when "Show more info" button is pressed). (Available in 2.4.5)

Note that you can display as many pins as you want, the only rule is that **ll** parameter comes before **n** and **id** for each point. 

When user selects a pin, your app is called like this:

    YourAppUniqueUrlScheme://pin?ll=lat,lon&n=PinName&id=PinId
